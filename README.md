      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m a full-time marketing field manager, a proud mom of three daughters, and someone learning to live—and thrive—with Myasthenia Gravis (MG), a rare neuromuscular disorder I was diagnosed with in August 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before my diagnosis, I was the definition of “go, go, go.” I managed a large team, ran a busy household, supported everyone around me, and rarely slowed down. But the stress of trying to do it all caught up with me and led to my first MG episode—and ultimately, my diagnosis. Since then, life has looked different, but it’s far from over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Living with MG means dealing with daily symptoms, ongoing treatments like apheresis every three weeks, and a full schedule of medications I take morning, night, and every few hours in between. I keep pill bottles in every room, in my car, in my purse—because MG doesn’t wait until it’s convenient. And still, I work, I parent, I love, I create.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve had to relearn how to live. I now delegate, organize, and work smarter—not harder. I’ve embraced asking for help, even for things I once felt embarrassed about. I’ve let go of the guilt of not doing everything and instead focused on doing the right things well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My team gets a more present, intentional leader. My kids get a mom who makes time for what matters. And I’ve found peace in small joys: reading, painting, baking, crocheting, walking, and making memories with my family.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">"Your old self is still you—this diagnosis hasn’t changed your mind or your soul."</p>
      <p>
        MG didn’t take away who I am—it just made me more aware of what I need to thrive. If you’re facing this diagnosis, know this: your life isn’t over. You are still you. And while some days will feel impossibly hard, you’ll also discover strength you never knew you had.
      </p>

      <h2>Stay Connected</h2>
      <p>
        I hope my story helps others living with MG feel seen, empowered, and supported. If you're on your own journey and want to connect, share, or just say hello—I'm here.
